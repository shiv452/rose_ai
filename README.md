## Introduction

The "ROSE AI" is a personal AI assistant designed to assist users with various tasks using voice commands. It provides functionalities such as opening applications, playing music, providing news updates, answering questions, and more.

## Implementation

The ROSE AI is implemented using Python and integrates several libraries for different functionalities:

1. Text Styling: The text output of ROSE AI is styled using the pyfiglet and termcolor libraries to enhance visual presentation.

2. Speech Synthesis: ROSE AI utilizes the edge-tts tool for speech synthesis, enabling it to speak responses to user queries.

3. Voice Recognition: Speech recognition functionality is achieved using the speech_recognition library, allowing ROSE AI to understand and process user voice commands.

4. GUI Automation: The pyautogui library is employed for GUI automation, enabling ROSE AI to interact with applications by simulating keyboard and mouse actions.

5. External APIs: ROSE AI leverages external APIs, such as the News API, to fetch real-time data and provide users with relevant information.

6. Multithreading: Threading is utilized to run certain functionalities, such as the introductory conversation with users, concurrently with the main program loop.
